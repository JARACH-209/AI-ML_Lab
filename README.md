>Juniors or any other student alike: 
Try to implement the assignments yourself because some of the codes might be highly customized to the problems statements.
I was also like you when implementing them, so, I did not care about making them reproducible, portable or generic.
Also, a piece of advice, implementing them on your own will give you a huge satisfaction and deeper understanding.
PEACE ! ;)
